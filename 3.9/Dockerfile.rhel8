ENV SUMMARY="Platform for building and running Python $PYTHON_VERSION applications" \
    DESCRIPTION="Python $PYTHON_VERSION available as container is a base platform for \
building and running various Python $PYTHON_VERSION applications and frameworks. \
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level \
data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. \
Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, \
make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas \
on most platforms."
